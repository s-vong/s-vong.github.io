<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
I want to clarify any misconception I had previously about metrics. First of all, it has no impact on optimizing and is only for evaluating the loss functions. Second, it is not a requirement to execute the compilation phase. What's all that is needed is to define "loss" and "optimizer." 
</p>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>
In Keras, the format is:
<br />
compile(loss='loss function', optimizer='optimizer algorithm', metrics=['first accuracy', 'second accuracy', .... 'third accuracy'])
<br />
with the ordinal accuracy being a different metric after every comma. Metrics requires an array of metrics if it is implemented. 
</p>

<b>Examples:</b>
Here are screenshots of different metrics being used. As you can see, the output is different with different input.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<b>Which one to use?</b>
<p>
    This question depends on what your output is going to be. Of course, binary_accuracy is used for two classes and categorical_accuracy is for multiple classes. However, when should we use the others? top_k_categorical_accuracy ranks the top 5 accuracies. The sparse metrics(sparse_categorical_accuracy and sparse_top_k_categorical_accuracy) are used for when targets are sparse. Each metrics is useful for specific circumstances.
