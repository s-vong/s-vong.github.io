<h2>Logistics of the blog</h2>
<p>
The main motivation for creating this website is to update on what I am currently working on. As you can see from the sporadic postings, I have not been keeping a set schedule. I took me quite a bit of effort to create every blog because I want to make sure I do not give out false information (in the event that some poor soul may venture onto one of my posts and think commit my words as fact. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, I will fix the low amount of content by limiting the time spent on my blog posts to under 10 minutes so all the things I say from now on will be unfiltered thoughts I have at the time. This means that inaccurate facts may occur more often, but this will let you in to how my mind works. Also, limiting my posting time will most likely motivate me to update this blog more often since I always saw this website like a chore. I pray for your soul, whoever decides to read this from now on.

<h2>Now onto my mistake(s)</h2>
<p>
I have underestimated packages, libraries, etc. created by the community and for that, I apologize. The only tools I have used were from big name companies (ie. Google's TensorFlow, Apache's Spark). It was only today that I decided to use a project from Github. Namely, I used <a href="https://github.com/bear/python-twitter">python-twitter</a> to interface with Twitter's API. Personally, I find the Twitter API documentation a headache to navigate. I challenge you to read Twitter API documentation and compare it to python-twitter documentation which can be found <a href="https://python-twitter..readthedocs.io">here</a>. I have been inventing wheels all this time when I could have just used free ones that already existed. I'll just end this as a lesson learned and hope I will never repeat this mistake every again.
