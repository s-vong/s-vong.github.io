<h2></h2>

<p>
I was finally able to work on my Spark Streaming project again. Regretfully, I only had two hours which felt more like 30 minutes. The last time I left off on the project is that I had the Twitter stream created using the twitter-python API and started off on creating the streaming context. My goal was to get the stream to connect to the Spark streaming context.

<p>
After doing some reading online, I understand that a method to accomplish this is to send the stream to a port using TCP while the Spark streaming context processes the data from that port. This proved to give me a refreasher on networking that I learned back in school in my Unix systems class.

I'll have to end today's work with a "ERRNO 32" termination message which is a broken pipe. Looks like I have another thing to research and try to debug. I'm doing this project little by little so I have not done any Spark transformations yet. Baby steps for now.
