    <p>This is my first blog and what better way to start it all off than to document the creation of this website? I never had the motivation to learn front-end web development mainly because I was busy with learning other things. Once I got started, I found myself to enjoy the process.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of hours just learning HTML and CSS, creating a website by scratch. When I decided to host it online, I chose GitHub to be my medium since I wanted this to be my professional site. It was then that I discovered that GitHub uses Jekyll, a Ruby tool that allows the user to create static webpages from markdown among a couple other formats. Databases wasn’t a factor in my decision since I’m only dealing with code which I could link to my repository and my basic information.</p>

<p>I had some hiccups along the way. From installing Jekyll to understanding how Ruby Gems and templates works, I’d like to think my mind is more flexible now. Now my greatest problem that I have been pondering since I started this project: “Do I want to pay money for a new spiffy url?”</p>
