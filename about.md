I graduated from University of California: Riverside in Summer of 2017 with a Bachelors of Science: Computer Science. For now, I plan to improve my skills and knowledge related to the software industry. Eventually, I would like to pursue graduate school also in computer science. My passion is artificial intelligence and I hope to improve myself everyday with it as my goal.

My life outside of my career is spent on my hobbies which are badminton, dance and food just to name a few. YouTube is my mode of entertainment when I just want to relax where I tend to watch comedians, dance or just random facts most people might not know. I am introverted, but not opposed to socializing. Small talk is my bane whereas meaningful conversations is something I enjoy.
