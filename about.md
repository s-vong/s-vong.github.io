I'm a graduate from University of California: Riverside with a Bachelors of Science: Computer Science. For now, I plan to improve my skills and knowledge related to the software industry. Eventually, I would like to pursue graduate school with a focus in a field in computer science. For now, I am happy learning of the new technologies that are innovating how we develop society.

My life outside of my career is spent on my hobbies which are badminton, dance and food just to name a few.
